- Exercises from Introduction to Jupyter (in Danish, from data-science-workshop.com)


# Fetching and calculating with data

## Computer language

Analogy - a different country:<br/>
Pointing and gestures vs language

GUI vs CLI

Examples of computer languages

## Progresssin

- calculation with data
- naming
- definitions

## Blooms taxonomy
