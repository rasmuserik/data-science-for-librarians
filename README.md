## Outline notes

Goal: get feet wet with python / data science on library data

- Intro / overview of workshop
- What is programming
    - Recipe, instructions for computer
        - computer = forvokset regnemaskine, kan kun g√∏re hvad den bliver bedt om
        - step by step instruction, computer is stupid, only does excatly what told
    - Example of programming languages easily available
        - JavaScript
        - Python
        - Shell
    - Getting started with Python/jupyter-notebooks
        - running within notebooks.azure.com
        - running locally with https://www.anaconda.com/download
- What is data
    - Concrete/paper examples: numbers, text, checkmark/questionmark, lists, indexes
    - Structured data: JSON
        - example/exercise bibliographical data
    - Numbers, Matrices/vectors
    - Data types
        - Numbers
        - Strings
        - Lists
        - Dictionaries
        - Matrices/vectors
        - ... and many morre
- What is data science
    - "datalogi" - computer science vs. data science
    - statistics and machine learning
        - unsupervised
            - example: k-means
